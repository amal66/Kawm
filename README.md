# Kawm

Kawm is a product created for CP194, designed to improve the reading experience by allowing users to embedd images, links and videos, ask and answer questions and have definitions and images embedded to reduce unnecessary scrolling. 

Prototype 1 demonstrates what the final product looks like. 

Prototype 2 implements login and the user flow for Minerva students.

Prototype 3 implements identification and embedding of definitions in PDF documents, so that the 3 core functionalities of Kawm can be tested if the PDF with embedded definitions is uploaded onto the Perusall Platform.
